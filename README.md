# LeetCode-py

A simple repository where I upload my Python solutions for various LeetCode challenges.  
The goal of this project is to practice algorithmic thinking, improve coding skills,  
and maintain a structured collection of solved exercises.

## Structure
Each file or folder contains an individual solution written in Python.

## How to Run
Clone the repository and execute any solution with:

```bash
python filename.py
